But It's comes under Apache stewardship.

1. Decoupling of Data Stream and Systems.
======================================
Apache Kafka, allows you to decouple your data streams and your systems. So now your source systems will have their data end up in 
Apache Kafka.While your target systems will source their data straight from Apache Kafka.

Refer the image in same repo for more understanding.

We can have any data stream you can think about.For example, it can be website events, pricing data,financial transactions, 
user interactions,and many more.Additionally, once the data is in Kafka,you may want to put it into any system you like,
such as a data base, your analytics systems,your email system, or your audits.

2. Ditributed, Resilient Architecture, Fault tolerant
======================================================

3. Horizontal Scalibility
==========================
It scales horizontally. Can scale to kafka clusters with 100's brokers. Can Scale to millions of messages per seconds

4. High Performance 
======================
Latency Of Less than 10ms in real time. (based of machine ). It used by LinkedIn, Netflix, Airbnb, Uber, Walmarts etc..
