Use Case
==========

1. Messaging system
2. Used for activity tracking.
3. Gather metrics from many different locations (starts as your samples or your IoT devices.)
4. Application logs gathering
5. Stream processing (with Kafka streams API, with Spark)
6. Decoupling of system dependencies.
7. Integrations with Spark, Flink, Storm, Hadoop and Many Other Big Data Technologies.

So this is quite a wide of array of use cases, and this is why so many companies are using Apache Kafka as their backbone in their company.

Example:
=========

Netflix is using Kafka to apply recommendations in real time while you're watching TV shows. And this is why, basically,
when you leave a TV show, you'll get a new recommendation right away.

Uber uses Kafka to gather user, taxi, and trip data in real time to compute and forecast demand, and computes the almighty surge 
pricing in real time. So Uber uses Kafka extensively.

LinkedIn uses Kafka to prevent spam, and their platform, collect user interactions and make better connection recommendations all of 
that in real time.

Kafka is only used as a transportation mechanism.
